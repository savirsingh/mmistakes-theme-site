## My Coolest Projects

I have *a lot* of projects, but here I have compiled a list of my favourite projects, including some of my biggest achievements.
* [BYTEsense](https://github.com/savirsingh/bytesense-htn-project) - BYTEsense is a Replit-hosted project built by me along with three other team members for Hack the North 2023. It is a prototype of a potentially life-changing tool which asks people to enter data after consuming a meal. Users give each meal a rating out of 3, and based on their ratings, BYTEsense will use LLMs, the OpenAI and Cohere APIs, and training data stored in a database to inform users how they will feel after consuming the meal. Our project won 2<sup>nd</sup> place for the "Best Hack Built on Replit". We were one of 250 teams at Canada's largest invite-only hackathon.

## Open-Source Projects
