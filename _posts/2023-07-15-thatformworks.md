A quick & simple guide to getting started with Thatformworks
---

In August 2022, I started a project that, once complete, would allow me to make HTML contact/reservation forms work. By January 2023, I completed a simple working version of this project - and decided to make it open for everyone as a free service. In this post, I go through the steps to use Thatformworks to make your HTML forms function properly.

### There are two methods you can choose from to access Thatformworks:

* Send a request quickly and efficiently online.
* Make a pull request and merge with the GitHub repository.

I'd recommend the first option since I very rarely check for pull requests and merging it would be a lengthy process. On the other hand, sending a request online is very simple and will get your forms working in no time at all!

### Option 1 - Sending an online request:

In order to send an online request, navigate to [the Thatformworks website](https://thatformworks.pythonanywhere.com). Next, type in your email address and submit the form! Soon, a team member will contact you regarding the setup of Thatformworks. It is usually a quick, free, and simple process.

---

### Option 2 - Creating a pull request:

In order to create a pull request, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/savirsingh/thatformworks) and make the request. It will likely take a long time to be reviewed and merged, which is why the first option is preferred.
