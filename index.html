    <p>Hi, I'm Savir!</p>

    <p>I'm a high school student from Canada. I love developing software, creating new technologies, competitive programming, and math, just to name a few things.</body>

    <p>I have several achievements that I'm proud of. Here's a short list:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>CEMC Distinction in Galois, Cayley, CCC, Fryer.</li>
        <li>Winning a gold medal in the Halton Skills Competition for Coding and representing the HDSB at the Ontario Skills Competition.</li>
        <li>Winning (first place) all the PEO-MC coding contests for my grade since I've been eligible. I also got first place at Mathletics.</li>
    </ul>
